/**
 * Common abstraction for implementations that manage the display and user manipulation
 * of {@link MapLayer} instances. This base class makes no assumption about the geometry
 * of the display device (e.g. flat video monitor using Cartesian coordinate system, or
 * planetarium dome using spherical coordinate system).
 *
 * <p>A newly constructed {@code Canvas} is initially empty. To make something appears, at least one
 * {@link MapLayer} must be added. The visual content depends on the {@link MapLayer} data and associated style.
 * The contents are usually symbols, features or images, but some implementations can also manage non-geographic
 * elements like a map scale.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition of the set of {@link MapLayer} to display,
 * a {@code Canvas} manages four fundamental properties:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The coordinate reference system to use for displaying data.</li>
 *   <li>The location of data to display in all dimensions, including the dimensions
 *       not shown by the display device (for example time).</li>
 *   <li>The size of the display device, in units of the display coordinate system.</li>
 *   <li>The conversion from the Coordinate Reference System to the display coordinate system.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Those properties are explained in more details below. Other information, for example the
 * geographic bounding box of the data shown on screen, are inferred from above properties.
 *
 * <h2>Coordinate Reference Systems</h2>
 * There is three {@linkplain CoordinateReferenceSystem Coordinate Reference Systems}
 * involved in the rendering of geospatial data:
 *
 * <ol class="verbose">
 *   <li>The <cite>data CRS</cite> is specific to the data to be displayed.
 *       It may be anything convertible to the <cite>objective CRS</cite>.
 *       Different {@link MapItem} instances may use different data CRS,
 *       potentially with a different number of dimensions.</li>
 *   <li>The {@linkplain #getObjectiveCRS objective CRS} is the common CRS in which all data
 *       are converted before to be displayed. If the objective CRS involves a map projection,
 *       it determines the deformation of shapes that user will see on the display device.
 *       The objective CRS should have the same number of dimensions than the display device
 *       (often 2). Its domain of validity should be wide enough for encompassing all data.
 *       The {@link org.apache.sis.referencing.CRS#suggestCommonTarget CRS.suggestCommonTarget(â€¦)}
 *       method may be helpful for choosing an objective CRS from a set of data CRS.</li>
 *   <li>The <cite>display CRS</cite> is the coordinate system of the display device.
 *       The conversion from <cite>objective CRS</cite> to <cite>display CRS</cite> should
 *       be an affine transform with a scale, a translation and optionally a rotation.
 *       This conversion changes every time that the user zooms or scrolls on viewed data.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Location of data to display</h2>
 * In addition of above-cited Coordinate Reference Systems, a {@code Canvas} contains also a point of interest.
 * The point of interest is often, but not necessarily, at the center of display area.
 * It can be expressed in any CRS; it does not need to be the objective CRS or the CRS of any data.
 * However the point of interest CRS must have enough dimensions for being convertible to the CRS of all data.
 * In other words the number of dimensions of the point of interest is equal or greater than the highest
 * number of dimensions found in data. The point of interest is used not only for defining which point to show
 * in (typically) the center of the display area, but also for defining which slice to select in all dimensions
 * not shown by the display device.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Example:</b> if some data have (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>,<var>z</var>) dimensions and
 * other data have (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>,<var>t</var>) dimensions, then the point of interest shall contain
 * coordinate values for at least all of the (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>,<var>z</var>,<var>t</var>) dimensions
 * (i.e. it must be 4-dimensional, even if all data in this example are 3-dimensional). If the display device
 * is a two-dimensional screen showing map in the (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) dimensions (horizontal plane),
 * then the point of interest defines the <var>z</var> value (elevation or depth) and the <var>t</var> value
 * (date and time) of the slice to show.</div>
 *
 * <h2>Display device size</h2>
 * The geographic extent of data to be rendered is constrained by the zoom level and the display device size.
 * The display size is given by {@link #getDisplayBounds()} as an envelope having the number of dimensions of
 * the display device. The zoom level is given indirectly by the {@link #getObjectiveToDisplay()} transform.
 * The display device may have a wraparound axis, for example in the spherical coordinate system of a planetarium.
