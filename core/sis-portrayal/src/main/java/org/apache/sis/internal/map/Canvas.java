/**
 * Common abstraction for implementations that manage the display and user manipulation
 * of {@link MapLayer} instances. This base class makes no assumption about the geometry
 * of the display device (e.g. flat video monitor using Cartesian coordinate system, or
 * planetarium dome using spherical coordinate system).
 *
 * <p>A newly constructed {@code Canvas} is initial empty. To make something appears, at least one
 * {@link MapLayer} must be added. The visual content depends on the {@link MapLayer} data and associated style.
 * The contents are usually symbols, features or images, but some implementations can also manage non-geographic
 * elements like a map scale.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is three {@linkplain CoordinateReferenceSystem coordinate reference systems}
 * involved (at least conceptually) in rendering of geospatial data:</p>
 *
 * <ol class="verbose">
 *   <li>The <cite>data CRS</cite> is specific to the data to be displayed.
 *       It may be anything convertible to the <cite>objective CRS</cite>.
 *       Different {@link MapItem} instances may use different data CRS,
 *       potentially with a different number of dimensions.</li>
 *   <li>The {@linkplain #getObjectiveCRS objective CRS} is the common CRS in which all data
 *       are converted before to be displayed. If the objective CRS involves a map projection,
 *       it determines the deformation of shapes that user will see on the display device.
 *       The objective CRS should have the same number of dimensions than the display device
 *       (often 2). Its domain of validity should be wide enough for encompassing all data.
 *       The {@link org.apache.sis.referencing.CRS#suggestCommonTarget CRS.suggestCommonTarget(â€¦)}
 *       method may be helpful for choosing an objective CRS from a set of data CRS.</li>
 *   <li>The <cite>device CRS</cite> is the coordinate system of the display device.
 *       The conversion from <cite>objective CRS</cite> to <cite>display CRS</cite> should
 *       be an affine transform with a scale, a translation and optionally a rotation.</li>
